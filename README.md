The following is a collection of project examples used in article "A Hybrid Logic-based Benders decomposition for building module transportation scheduling with hydrogen vehicle substitution and limited parking".  

All 270 instances are composed of two types of data files: (1) construction site information data containing the number of construction sites, transportation time to different construction sites and carbon emissions; (2) parameter information containing the number of modules required for each construction site, the number of vehicles in the fleet, carbon emission limits, the duration of stage 2 and stage 3, the capacity of temporary parking areas, storage costs and delay costs.
